## Project Overview  
In this module, we created a map to organize census data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This map has the ability to filter data based on a drop-down table selection and is created using jQuery as the primary coding language.  

## Resources  
- **Software:** VS Code, Jupyter Notebook   
- **Languages:** HTML, JSON, jQuery  
- **Data Source:** [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov)    

## Objectives  
- Import, analyze, clean, and preprocess a “real-world” classification dataset  
- Create, populate, and dynamically filter a map using jQuery, JavaScript and HTML
